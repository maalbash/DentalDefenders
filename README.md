# DentalDefenders
Dental Defenders is a 2D (top-down view) survival game in which the player must protect itself and a tooth from incoming
enemies. The tooth is stationary in the middle of the screen and the player needs to kill the enemies in order to ensure their collective survival. 

Points are gained by combination of eliminating enemies and the total time that both the player and the tooth manage to survive. The objective of the game is to maximize the points earned. If either the player or the tooth runs out of life, the game ends.

Processing, which is required to run this game, can be downloaded from https://www.processing.org/.
To run the program, one must have the core.jar library from the Processing installation directory added to the project structure. Once that is done, running the Engine.java class will create the canvas and run the interactive simulation.

The detailed description of the game, code and evaluation results are covered in the pdf file titled "Game_Paper".
